# Fit a survey weighted linear regression

# Input the original dataset and get predicted estimates 
#for each value of the independent variable

# Estimate survey means and survey CIs for different ranges 
# of the independent variable
# e.g. age in 1 year intervals

# Plot the survey means and CIs as a scatterplot


# Alternatively only report the survey weighted correlations



# Survey weighted histograms are possible
# Check if survey weighted boxplots are possible - not sure
# You can estimate survey median, survey 25th percentile and survey 75th percentile
# Use svyquantile
